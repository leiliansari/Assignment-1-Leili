	<p>I'm Leili Ansari, a chocolate-crazed writer based in Boston. Visit my food blog <a href="http://www.yinandyolk.com">Yin and Yolk</a> to find out more. I have always loved to cook, bake, and eat food, but after studying in Montreal for two years and then graduating from Harvard Extension School, I found that I enjoyed writing about food and my travels even more. Today, I work, blog, and am currently taking a class to learn how to code. View my full portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here.</a></p>

	<h3 class="font-face">Summary</h3>
				
	<p>I have taken many writing-intensive courses throughout my college career, and now use those skills to write for my very own website. I have a breadth of kitchen experience, both from working at a bakery and from attending culnary classes at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts. These skills combined have opened the doors to writing my own e-Cookbook, and now I plan on attending graduate school in London this fall to pursue a master's degree in Publishing. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, listening to comedy podcasts, and traveling as much as humanly possible.</p>
